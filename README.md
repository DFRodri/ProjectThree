# Capital Quiz
<p>Project #3 of the Android Basics Nano-Degree</p>

### Short Description
<p>Small quiz about capital cities of the world.</p>
<br>
<p>It's basically a Quiz like many others but instead of going with the obvious and easy scroll view with a submit button at the bottom, I implemented distinct viewgroups with each one handling the display of each type of question.</p>
<p>It's nothing fancy but I like how I achieved something that looks dynamic while restraining myself to a single activity.</p>
<p>I also used this to try to implement a splash screen as it should be. I like the results, it looks good with the intro screen right after it</p>
